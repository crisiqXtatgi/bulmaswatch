## What are CM93 v2 Charts?
 
CM93 v2 charts are a collection of vector-based nautical charts that cover most of the world's oceans and coastal areas. They are derived from the C-Map 93 format, which is a proprietary format developed by Jeppesen Marine, a subsidiary of C-Map. C-Map 93 charts are widely used by commercial and recreational mariners for navigation and planning purposes. They contain various layers of information, such as depth contours, buoys, lights, landmarks, ports, tides, currents, and more.
 
CM93 v2 charts are not the same as C-Map 93 charts. They are an unofficial version that was hacked and modified by unknown parties. They are distributed through peer-to-peer networks, torrent sites, forums, and other online platforms. The quality and accuracy of CM93 v2 charts may vary depending on the source and date of the files. Some CM93 v2 charts may be outdated, incomplete, or inaccurate. Some may also contain malware or viruses that can harm your computer or device.
