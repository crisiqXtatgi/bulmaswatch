In this article, we will review some of the features and benefits of ChemDraw Pro 12.0.16, and how it can help you create publication-ready, scientifically meaningful drawings for your chemistry research.
 
## What is ChemDraw Pro?
 
ChemDraw Pro is a drawing tool that allows you to create chemical structures, reactions, mechanisms, schemes, spectra, and more. You can use it to draw molecules from scratch, or import them from various file formats, such as SMILES, InChI, Molfile, or CDX. You can also use templates and nicknames to quickly draw common structures or functional groups.
 
ChemDraw Pro also provides chemical query properties, such as atom lists, bond types, ring sizes, charges, stereochemistry, and more. You can use these properties to search chemical databases or perform structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis. ChemDraw Pro supports a wide range of chemical file formats for input and output, such as SDF, MOL2, CML, RXN, RDF, SKC, and more.
 
ChemDraw Pro also integrates with other ChemOffice applications, such as Chem3D, ChemFinder, and ChemACX. You can use Chem3D to generate 3D models of your molecules and perform molecular modeling calculations. You can use ChemFinder to manage your chemical data and perform structure-based or text-based searches. You can use ChemACX to access millions of commercially available compounds and their properties.
 
## What's New in ChemDraw Pro 12.0.16?
 
ChemDraw Pro 12.0.16 is the latest version of this software, released in 2023 by PerkinElmer Informatics. It includes several enhancements and new features that make it easier and faster to create publication-ready chemical drawings. Some of these features are:
 
- A new user interface that is more intuitive and modern.
- A new freehand pen tool that allows you to draw structures with your mouse or stylus.
